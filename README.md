# HTMLCSSDemo

This is a simple website built entirely with **HTML and CSS**.  
It is **not responsive**, so it works best on desktop screens.  

## Project Structure

To view the website properly, please open the files in the following order:
1. `loading.html` — the loading screen
2. `welcome.html` — welcome page
3. `site.html` — website

## Features
- Built with HTML5 and CSS3
- Simple and clean design
- Static website (no JavaScript or backend)
- For learning and demonstration purposes

## How to Run
Open the `.html` files in a web browser. Start with `loading.html` to see the loading screen first.
